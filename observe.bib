   abstract = {This paper proposes an effective method to detect the passive tag's velocity. When a tag is moving, the energy distribution between received baseband signal I and Q changes over time as a result of both the Doppler Effect and the change of distance between reader and tag. Without any modification of the antenna, only one conventional reader was used to detect the change of distribution to calculate the velocity. This method was proved effective in the laboratory environment and it has great potential to be applied in the highway vehicle speed system in the future.},

@article{Choy2020,
   abstract = {This paper presents a high scalability real-time intelligent traffic monitoring system, based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The main features of this system are low cost, low power consumption, traffic monitoring, and connectivity. The system's architecture includes an RFID reader, a passive tag, and a Raspberry Pi. Our solution collects vehicle information from the labels and stores the data into a database by employing only one antenna. The main challenge is that the RFID module is not robust enough to recognize the information in the vehicle's RFID tag on each information query, while the label is in the reading zone. This instability does not allow us to know precisely when and where a vehicle enters or leaves the sensing zone. What is more, the high random error in the power signal and the complexity of its characteristic curve pattern add difficulty to the speed calculation, when we reduce the number of antennas to one. For this reason, an innovative approach has been designed, using customized modular neural network (MNN). This method fits the collected data (power signal vs time) affected by acute random noise, to the characteristic correspondence function among the signal power and the position of the terminal, which domains are dimensionally different. As a result, we can estimate the vehicle speeds and obtain the whole vehicle information. Under this novel method, we are able to reduce the hardware, in comparison with previous approaches, making it cheaper and decreasing power consumption.},

The system can detect empty parking spaces by the reader mounted on the drone, and guide vehicles looking for a parking space to the nearest one. Our design can also calculate the parking fee based on time duration between the arrival and the departure of the parking vehicle, and charge to the owner automatically. We believe that the proposed system has numerous unique advantages over other solutions, such as camera-based system and those that requires sensors installed for each parking space. We hope that the idea can be quickly realized through this project and put into real use in the near future.},

@article{Garcia2018,
   abstract = {This paper presents a system with location functionalities for the inventory of traffic signs based on passive RFID technology. The proposed system simplifies the current video-based techniques, whose requirements regarding visibility are difficult to meet in some scenarios, such as dense urban areas. In addition, the system can be easily extended to consider any other street facilities, such as dumpsters or traffic lights. Furthermore, the system can perform the inventory process at night and at a vehicle&rsquo;s usual speed, thus avoiding interfering with the normal traffic flow of the road. Moreover, the proposed system exploits the benefits of the passive RFID technologies over active RFID, which are typically employed on inventory and vehicular routing applications. Since the performance of passive RFID is not obvious for the required distance ranges on these in-motion scenarios, this paper, as its main contribution, addresses the problem in two different ways, on the one hand theoretically, presenting a radio wave propagation model at theoretical and simulation level for these scenarios; and on the other hand experimentally, comparing passive and active RFID alternatives regarding costs, power consumption, distance ranges, collision problems, and ease of reconfiguration. Finally, the performance of the proposed on-board system is experimentally validated, testing its capabilities for inventory purposes.},

abstract = {Nowadays, due to the global trends of urbanization. Complex urban structure leads to the positioning inaccuracy issue in Global Positioning System (GPS) or even conventional navigation failure. To deal with the positioning inaccuracy issue and/or navigation failure, the real time updated environmental information are required to be provided. Thanks to the developments of Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) communication systems and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems, the real time vehicular and positioning information can be collected to deal with the position inaccuracy problem, and the navigation system can be improved by local information exchanging with vehicles and infrastructure. In the previous works, the proposed systems can increase accuracy or help GPS locate the vehicle. However, the drawbacks are that the designed systems cannot locate vehicle and do path planning independently without GPS. In this thesis, an RFID-enhanced VANET system is proposed to provide accurate path planning, determined at a server in a real time manner based on the shared vehicular information and positioning information. Specifically, the RFID system is utilized for reading accurate positioning information stored in RFID tags, and vehicular information can be collected and delivered to the server via VANETs. The server integrates this information and calculates the fastest time path for the individual vehicles. Simulations demonstrate that our system can perform more accurate positioning and efficient path planning, compared to the traditional navigation system based on GPS.},
